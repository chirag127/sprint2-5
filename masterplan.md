# Masterplan for Online Grocery Ordering System

## Document Information

-   **Version**: 1.0
-   **Owner**: Chirag Singhal
-   **Status**: Final
-   **Prepared for**: AI Code Assistant

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the masterplan for building a full-featured Online Grocery Ordering System. The project's primary goal is to provide a seamless digital platform for customers to browse, search, and order groceries online, and for administrators to manage users, products, and orders efficiently.

The technical approach involves a modern, decoupled architecture with a React single-page application (SPA) for the frontend and a robust Java-based REST API for the backend, built using the Spring Boot framework. Data will be stored in a PostgreSQL database. User authentication will be handled securely using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The initial version will support "Cash on Delivery" (COD) as the exclusive payment method.

Key milestones include setting up the core architecture, implementing user and product management, developing the complete e-commerce workflow (cart, checkout), and deploying the application for production use. Success will be measured by user adoption, order volume, and system reliability.

## 2. Project Overview

-   **Problem Statement**: Customers lack a convenient, user-friendly online platform to order groceries from a local store. Administrators require an efficient system to manage product inventory, customer information, and incoming orders.
-   **Solution**: A web-based application that allows customers to register, search for products, add them to a cart, and place orders for cash on delivery. It will also provide an administrative interface for managing the platform's data.
-   **Target Audience**:
    -   **Primary Users (Customers)**: Individuals looking for a convenient way to shop for groceries online.
    -   **Secondary Users (Administrators)**: Staff responsible for managing the online store's inventory, customer accounts, and processing orders.
-   **Core Objectives**:
    -   Develop a secure and scalable platform for online grocery ordering.
    -   Provide an intuitive and responsive user interface for customers.
    -   Create a comprehensive admin panel for easy management.
    -   Ensure reliable order processing with email notifications.
    -   Implement a review and rating system to build community trust.

## 3. Technical Stack and Architecture

-   **Frontend**: React, React Router, TanStack Query, Zustand, Axios, Tailwind CSS.
-   **Backend**: Java 17, Spring Boot, Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security.
-   **Database**: PostgreSQL.
-   **Infrastructure**: Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment.
-   **Third-party Services**:
    -   **Email**: Mailgun or SendGrid for transactional emails (e.g., registration confirmation, order receipts).
-   **Architecture Pattern**: Monolithic backend application providing RESTful APIs to a decoupled React frontend application.

## 4. Project Scope

### 12.2 Code Organization Principles

-   Follow standard Java and React conventions.
-   Separate concerns clearly between controllers, services, and repositories in the backend.
-   Use a component-based architecture in the frontend, grouping components by feature or reusability.
-   Centralize API communication in the `frontend/src/services` and `frontend/src/lib` directories.

## 13. Environment Variables and Configuration

### 13.1 Environment Variables (.env.example)

```bash
# Backend - application.properties
# Database Configuration
SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/grocery_db
SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME=postgres

```

## 14. Testing Strategy and Quality Assurance

### 14.1 Testing Approach

-   **Unit Tests**: Backend services and utility classes will be tested with JUnit and Mockito. Frontend components and hooks will be tested with Jest and React Testing Library.
-   **Integration Tests**: Backend API endpoints will be tested using Spring Boot's test framework (`@SpringBootTest`) and `MockMvc`.
-   **End-to-End Tests**: Critical user flows (registration, login, add to cart, checkout) will be tested using Cypress.
-   **Code Coverage**: Aim for a minimum of 80% code coverage for backend services and frontend components.

## 15. Deployment Strategy

### 15.1 Deployment Architecture

-   **Production**: The React app will be deployed as a static site (e.g., on Netlify, Vercel, or AWS S3/CloudFront). The Spring Boot backend will be containerized using Docker and deployed to a platform like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
-   **Staging**: A separate staging environment mirroring production for pre-release testing.

### 15.2 Deployment Process

-   **CI/CD**: Use GitHub Actions.
    -   On push to `main` branch, the pipeline will run all tests, build the Java JAR and the React static files, build a Docker image for the backend, and push it to a container registry.
    -   The pipeline will then deploy the new image to the production/staging environment.
-   **Database Migrations**: Use a tool like Flyway or Liquibase to manage and apply database schema changes automatically during deployment.

## 16. Maintenance and Risk Management

### 16.1 Maintenance Strategy

-   **Corrective Maintenance**: Monitor logs and error tracking. Prioritize and fix bugs based on severity.
-   **Preventive Maintenance**: Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities and improve performance.
-   **Adaptive Maintenance**: Evolve the application by adding new features based on user feedback.

### 16.2 Risk Assessment

-   **Technical Risks**: Third-party service (email) outage. Mitigation: Implement retry logic and robust error handling.
-   **Security Risks**: Data breach due to vulnerabilities. Mitigation: Adhere to security best practices, perform regular dependency scans, and conduct security audits.
-   **Operational Risks**: Production deployment failure. Mitigation: Implement a blue-green or canary deployment strategy and have a clear rollback plan.

## 17. Future Enhancements and Development Guidelines

### 17.1 Future Roadmap

-   **Short-term**: Implement online payment integration (Stripe). Add social logins.
-   **Medium-term**: Develop a promotion/coupon engine. Implement more advanced product search filters (by category, price range).
-   **Long-term**: Introduce a mobile application (React Native). Explore machine learning for personalized product recommendations.

### 17.2 Development Standards

-   **Git Workflow**: Use a feature-branching workflow (e.g., GitFlow). All code must be reviewed and pass CI checks before being merged into `main`.
-   **Code Style**: Use Prettier/ESLint for frontend and Google Java Style Guide (with Checkstyle) for the backend to ensure consistency.
-   **Documentation**: Document all public API endpoints and complex business logic. Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md`.
